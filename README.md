NSL Pulse
=========

Drops useful summary data concerning an active LAMP stack server. May be
utilised by an autonomous client to sweep across a cluster of servers to
pinpoint those approaching load capacities and maintain an eye on running
database processes.

Clients may thereafter be configured to dispatch alerts to admin personnel
to address these key infrastructural concerns.
